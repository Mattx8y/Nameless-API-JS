This is the [GitHub Pages branch](https://github.com/Mattx8y/Nameless-API-JS/tree/gh-pages). [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Mattx8y/Nameless-API-JS/actions) automatically builds the JSDoc and pushes it along with the [master/docs](https://github.com/Mattx8y/Nameless-API-JS/tree/master/docs) to this branch so DO NOT MODIFY IT. Modify the docs folder to add content to the website (the docs folder will not be pushed to npm)
